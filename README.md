## Over of the Analysis
![Schemas](https://github.com/naomishields/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/EmployeeDB.png)

The purpose of this project was to use the Pewlett Hackard Data and the schemas (seen above) that we created to preform queries. These queries were to help the company restructure the given data to address their concerns. The first set of queries creates a table that gives the number of retiring employees by job title. The second set of queries creates a tabkle that gives the employees that are eligible for the company's mentorship program. 

## Results
There were two deliverables created with the two sets of queries. The first deliverable (seen below) shows the table of the count of retiring employees by job title.

The second deliverable (seen below) gives us a table of 1,549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program.

Based on the two deliverables we can see that:
* The two positions with the most people retiring are the Senior Engineer position and the Senior Staff position, with 29,414 and 28,254 employees retiring.
* The position with the least amount of people retiring is the Manager position, with only two employees retiring.
* There is also a decent amount of Engineers and Staff retiring, with 14,222 and 12,243 employees retiring. Then there are 4,502 Technique Leaders and 1,761 Assistant Engineers retiring.
* There are far more employees retiring than there are employees eligible for the mentorship program.
