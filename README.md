# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Over of the Analysis
![Schemas](https://github.com/naomishields/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/EmployeeDB.png)

The purpose of this project was to use the Pewlett Hackard Data and the schemas (seen above) that we created to preform queries. These queries were to help the company restructure the given data to address their concerns. The first set of queries creates a table that gives the number of retiring employees by job title. The second set of queries creates a tabkle that gives the employees that are eligible for the company's mentorship program. 

## Results
There were two deliverables created with the two sets of queries. The first deliverable (seen below) shows the table of the count of retiring employees by job title.

The second deliverable (seen below) gives us a table of 1,549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program.

Based on the two deliverables we can see that:
* The two positions with the most people retiring are the Senior Engineer position and the Senior Staff position, with 29,414 and 28,254 employees retiring.
* The position with the least amount of people retiring is the Manager position, with only two employees retiring.
* There is also a decent amount of Engineers and Staff retiring, with 14,222 and 12,243 employees retiring. Then there are 4,502 Technique Leaders and 1,761 Assistant Engineers retiring.
* There are far more employees retiring than there are employees eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary 
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  Ultimately, 90,398 roles are going to have to be filled as the "silver tsunami" happens. 
 * Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  It would not appear that there are. There are only 1,549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program compared tot the 90,398 roles that need to be filled. 
  
There are two additional tables that I think would be helpful:
1. A table that that provides employee information for those who were born in 1965-1967 and are still current employees. I think it would be useful to expand the number of employees that could be eligible for the mentorship program. 
2. A table that provides the count of retiring employees by their gender. I think this will be helpful because it will help the company be aware of some of the diversity they may be losing and they can keep that in mind to make sure they maintain an inclusive workspace.
